This repository contains a demonstration. So, copy only 'EmptyState' folder into your Xcode project. It contains the EmptyStateView.h and EmptyStateView.m files.

## How To Use

`EmptyStateView` is a custom UIView with an image, title and description text.
It will look as simple as this:

[emptyView addImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@"empty-state-users"] withDistance:10.f];
[emptyView addDescription:@"There's no Content!" withDistance:20.f];

[self.view addSubview: emptyView];
```
